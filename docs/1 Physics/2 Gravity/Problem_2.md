# Problem 2

# Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities

## Cosmic Velocities

### 1. First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity)

**Definition:**  
The minimum velocity required for an object to enter a stable circular orbit around a celestial body, just above its surface.

**Formula:**  
$v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$

- $G$ is the gravitational constant.

- $M$ is the mass of the celestial body.

- $R$ is the radius of the celestial body.

**Physical Meaning:**  
This is the speed needed to counteract gravity with centrifugal force, enabling continuous free fall around the body—i.e., low Earth orbit.

**Example (Earth):**  
Approximately **7.9 km/s**



### 2. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity)

**Definition:**  
The minimum speed needed to break free from the gravitational pull of a celestial body without further propulsion.

**Formula:**  
$v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$

**Physical Meaning:**  
At this velocity, an object will escape into space without falling back, moving away indefinitely unless acted upon by other forces.

**Example (Earth):**  
Approximately **11.2 km/s**



### 3. Third Cosmic Velocity (Solar Escape Velocity from Earth Orbit)

**Definition:**  
The speed required to escape the gravitational influence of the **Sun** when starting from **Earth’s orbit**.

**Formula (approximate):**  
$v_3 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{\text{Sun}}}{R_{\text{orbit}}}} - v_{\text{Earth orbit}}$

Where:
- $R_{\text{orbit}}$ is the Earth's orbital radius around the Sun.
- $v_{\text{Earth orbit}} \approx 29.8 \text{ km/s}$

**Physical Meaning:**  
This velocity allows a spacecraft to leave the Solar System, overcoming the Sun’s gravitational pull.

**Example (from Earth orbit):**  
Approximately **16.7 km/s** relative to Earth.

These are idealized values and do not consider atmosphere, terrain, or other practical factors in spaceflight.
