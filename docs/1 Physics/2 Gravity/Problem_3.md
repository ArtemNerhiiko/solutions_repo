# Problem 3

## 1. Analyzing the possible trajectories (e.g., parabolic, hyperbolic, elliptical) of a payload released near Earth.


The trajectory of a payload released near Earth depends primarily on its velocity relative to Earth and the influence of Earth's gravity. These trajectories can generally be categorized into three conic sections: **elliptical**, **parabolic**, and **hyperbolic**.


### 1. **Elliptical Trajectory (0 < v < vₑ)**

- **Description**: The payload moves in an elliptical orbit around Earth.

- **Condition**: 

- Initial velocity $v$ is less than the escape velocity $vₑ$.

- $0 < v < vₑ$

- **Outcome**: The payload remains bound to Earth and will continue orbiting unless acted upon by another force (e.g., atmospheric drag or propulsion).



### 2. **Parabolic Trajectory (v = vₑ)**

- **Description**: The payload follows a parabolic escape trajectory.

- **Condition**: 

- Initial velocity $v$ is exactly equal to Earth's escape velocity $vₑ$.

- $v = vₑ$

- **Outcome**: The payload escapes Earth's gravity but with zero excess velocity at infinity.



### 3. **Hyperbolic Trajectory (v > vₑ)**
- **Description**: The payload follows a hyperbolic path, escaping Earth’s gravity.

- **Condition**:

- Initial velocity $v$ exceeds Earth's escape velocity $vₑ$.

- $v > vₑ$

- **Outcome**: The payload escapes Earth with positive velocity at infinity, continuing into interplanetary space.



### 4. **Straight-Line (Radial) Trajectory**

- **Special Case**: If the payload is released directly upward or downward, the trajectory may still be parabolic, hyperbolic, or elliptical, but without angular momentum (degenerate conic sections).


## Key Terms and Formulas

- **Escape Velocity ($vₑ$)**:

$$ vₑ = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}} $$

Where:

- $G$ = gravitational constant

- $M$ = mass of Earth 

- $R$ = distance from Earth’s center to the payload  

- **Total Mechanical Energy ($E$)**:

  $$ E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r} $$

- If $E < 0$: elliptical 

- If $E = 0$: parabolic  

- If $E > 0$: hyperbolic
