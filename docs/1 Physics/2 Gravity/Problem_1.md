# Problem 1

# Orbital Period and Orbital Radius

### The relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius, known as Kepler's Third Law, is a cornerstone of celestial mechanics. This simple yet profound relationship allows for the determination of planetary motions and has implications for understanding gravitational interactions on both local and cosmic scales. By analyzing this relationship, one can connect fundamental principles of gravity with real-world phenomena such as satellite orbits and planetary systems.

# 1. Deriving the relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius for circular orbits.

### Step 1: Centripetal Force and Gravitational Force
For a body of mass $m$ orbiting a central mass $M$, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force:

$F_g = F_c$

Using Newton's law of universal gravitation:

$F_g = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$

And the centripetal force:

$F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r}$

Equating both forces:

$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r}$

Cancel $m$ (assuming $m \neq 0$):

$\frac{GM}{r^2} = \frac{v^2}{r}$

Rearrange to express velocity:

$v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$

### Step 2: Expressing Orbital Period $T$
The orbital period $T$ is given by:
$$
T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}
$$
Substituting $v$ from above:
$$
T = \frac{2\pi r}{\sqrt{GM/r}}
$$
Simplify:
$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}
$$
