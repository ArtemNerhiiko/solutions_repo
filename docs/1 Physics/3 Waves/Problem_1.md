# Problem 1

A circular wave on the water surface, emanating from a point source located at $(x_0, y_0)$, can be described by the Single Disturbance equation:

$$
\eta(x, y, t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cdot \cos(kr - \omega t + \phi)
$$

where:

- $\eta(x, y, t)$ is the displacement of the water surface at point $(x, y)$ and time $t$,

- $A$ is the amplitude of the wave,

- $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, related to the wavelength $\lambda$,

- $\omega = 2\pi f$ is the angular frequency, related to the frequency $f$,

- $r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}$ is the distance from the source to the point $(x, y)$,

- $\phi$ is the initial phase.
